You are standing at the Cookieland.
The sky, floor, and walls are made of scrumptious cookies - everywhere you are surrounded by cookies. But in the centre of the room slumbers the Cookie Monster and in his right hand lies the universe's most delectable cookie, radiating brilliantly with an irresistible scent. You are swiftly enticed to consume the forbidden treat.

>>> Check what? 
You don't have that!

>>> You deftly seize the cookie but before you can consume the forbidden treat you are interrupted by the Cookie Monster, who having realised the situation, enters a frenzy of rage and begins to gobble up the room. You pack the cookie away to eat at a later time but are continuously empowered by its wafting scent.
