You are standing at the Cookieland.
The sky, floor, and walls are made of scrumptious cookies - everywhere you are surrounded by cookies.

>>> #00: Choc-Chip Cookie     - SEIZE the cookie from the slumbering Cookie Monster.
#01: The One Ring         - WEAR the prized ring of the Dark Lord, Sauron. [COMPLETED]
