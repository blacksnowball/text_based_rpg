You are standing at the Black Gates of Mordor.
An innocuous golden ring clasped by a chain glimmers against the backdrop of an eerie dark sky, dangling precariously on a crack in the impregnable walls of the Black Gates.

>>> You move towards the ring but are startled by a hissing voice. "My Precious! Get away from my precious!", it viciously asserts. Fearing that your presence has been detected, you stray away from the ring.

You are standing at the Misty Mountains.
An enormous pack of ferocious wyverns are scattered all across the sides of the mountain range. They gaze intently in your direction thinking about you as their next meal. Your view of the landscape is blocked by their monstrous size but that should be the least of your concerns.

>>> You desperately try to hold the snowball but it keeps slipping out of your hands, rolling away as if it were taunting you!

You are standing at the Bastille.
From afar, you gaze at a great, sinister fortress before turning your attention to a lavish, royal palace not far from it. You can feel an atmosphere of great tension as people pass by you, murmuring about their discontent with a man named King Louis XVI.

>>> You attempt to rally the nearby people to your cause but they all seem to be distracted by baguettes, croissants, and complaining about taxation and fiscal policy.

You are swiftly enticed to consume the forbidden treat.

>>> You muster the courage to move forward but your first step accidentally crushes some cookies on the ground. The Cookie Monster, having been startled by the sound, abruptly wakes with bulging eyes and screams "COOKIE!" before falling back to sleep. Stricken with fear, your swiftly step back.
